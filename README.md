# :wave: Hello, World! 
Welcome to my GitHub profile. I have got some exciting projects brewing over the next few weeks so watch this space :woman_cook:

## :smiley: About Me 
I am a Sydney-based Software Developer in training transitioning from being an Optometrist :nerd_face:
Why the change? I am always looking for new challenges and ways to grow and I am excited by the embrace the new worlds of knowledge in the universe that is software engineering :milky_way:


I would love to hear from you if you have any openings for projects and/or opportunities. I will be available from early May 2023. Reach out to me through Linkedin or email
